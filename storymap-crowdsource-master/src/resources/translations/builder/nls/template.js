To avoid this situation you can convert any supporting layers to feature layers before adding them to your map and use simple symbols. 2) There is also a possibility that the data model for the crowdsource layer may change. If this occurs, we intend to provide a workflow or tool to update your layer to the new data model.'

Open your story\'s <% map %>, add layers and/or change the basemap, and save your changes. The next time you load your story you will see the new layers. Be careful not to delete or modify the contributions layer in your map or your Crowdsource story may stop working properly.'

This will create an ArcGIS public account linked to the contributor\'s social media account, but contributors won\'t receive emails from Esri when they sign in like this.
